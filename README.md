College project saved here for archival purposes

This project was for a bata ase class in college, i created the whole frontend, the project never worked with data bases, never had a connection to any data base, so my solution? Fake the process to record data to a data base without recording nothing

Ingenious right? The frontend, was truly ugly, at least i passed the class.
